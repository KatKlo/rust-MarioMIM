# MarioMIM

## Description
Since CLion has shown us the first segfaults, we wanted to write a computer game inspired by 
the student’s adventure during pursuing a Computer Science degree. MarioMIM is a platform game 
in which the idea is to ... pass. We’ve created a game inspired by Super Mario Bros, but in 
a special University of Warsaw edition. In order to overcome bugs the student can strengthen himself 
by drinking coffee or learning the best programming language - Rust.
